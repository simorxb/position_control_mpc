## Summary
This project demonstrates the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to a classical position control problem of a damped mass system. The control algorithm is implemented and simulated using MATLAB/Simulink.

## Project Overview
Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an advanced control strategy that solves an optimization problem at each control step, predicting the system behavior over a finite horizon. This project focuses on the control of a mass-spring-damper-like system, where a mass is subject to damping and external force, with the objective of accurately controlling its position.

The system's dynamics are modeled in MATLAB, and a linear MPC controller is designed using state-space representation. The implementation highlights key aspects such as tuning, constraints, and simulation outcomes, providing insights into the effectiveness of MPC for linear position control tasks.

## System Model
The physical system considered is a mass $m = 10 ~ kg$, sliding on a surface with damping coefficient $k = 0.5 ~ N \cdot s/m$, controlled by an external force $F$. The dynamic equation governing the system is:

$$
m \cdot \ddot{z} = F - k \cdot \dot{z}
$$

### State-Space Representation
To design an MPC controller, the system is represented in state-space form:

$\dot{x} = A \mathbf{x} + B u$

$y = C \mathbf{x} + D u$

Where:
- $\mathbf{x} = [\dot{z}, z]^T$
- $u = F$

Matrices:
- $$A = \begin{bmatrix} -k/m & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -0.05 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$
- $B = \begin{bmatrix} 1/m \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- $C = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
- $D = 0$

## MPC Tuning & Implementation
The linear MPC controller was configured in MATLAB with the following specifications:

### Tuning Parameters
- **Scaling Factors**:
  - Output Variable: 2
  - Manipulated Variable: 10
- **Weights**:
  - Output Variable: 1
  - Manipulated Variable: 0
  - Manipulated Variable Rate of Change: 0.1
- **Constraints**:
  - Output Variable: $[-2, 2]\, m$
  - Manipulated Variable: $[-10, 10]\, N$
- **MPC Parameters**:
  - Sample Time: $0.1\, s$
  - Prediction Horizon: 10
  - Control Horizon: 2

### MATLAB Implementation
- The linear MPC object was created using MATLABâ€™s `mpc` command, utilizing the defined state-space model.
- Simulation was performed using the `sim` function over a time span of 5 seconds.

## Simulation Results
The MPC algorithm achieved smooth position control with minimal overshoot. Since the same model was used for both the controller design and validation, the system performance was nearly ideal. Future improvements could include robustness testing and disturbance rejection analysis.
